`email-miner` makes it easy to mine IMAP mailboxes in a simple pythonic way. It is as a thin-wrapper around the awesome [IMAPClient](https://github.com/mjs/imapclient) library.

### Installation

`email-miner` is listed on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/email-miner/) and can be installed with pip:

```bash
pip install email-miner
```

### Example

```python
from email_miner.miner import Miner

# miner acts as a context manager to ensure connections are closed
with Miner('imap.gmail.com', 'john@gmail.com', 'xyzzy') as client:

    # folder switching as a context manager to ensure folder is closed
    with client.inbox(read_only=True):
    
        # get emails from the selected folder as a list
        emails = client.get_emails(unread_only=True, with_body=True)
       
        for email in emails:
            print('Subject:', email.subject)
            print('From:', email.from_addresses)
            print('To:', email.to_addresses)
            
            # the body is already parsed 
            # and the attachments can be accessed directly
            for attachment in email.attachments:
                
                print('Attachment type:', attachment.content_type)
                print('Attachment name:', attachment.file_name)
                
                with open(attachment.file_name, 'wb') as file:
                    file.write(attachment.file_content)
```
